For our project, we want to create a tetris clone. The end goal of our project is that we have a working score system and leaderboard where people can log in and keep track of their highscores via the leaderboard and hopefully compare scores with friends. The tetris gameplay will match that of traditional tetris and the website will consist of a login screen where players enter the same name that will be tracked on the leaderboard, and the game itself. Additionally, to satisfy the static element portion, we will have a tutorial that will show players how to play the game.

For the technologies that we plan to use, we think that we will use TypeScript to try something new. Additionally, we will employ Node.js and Express.js for our project. For our database, we will use MongoDB as we are more familiar with it through exprience with project 3.
